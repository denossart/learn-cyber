Influences on cybersecurity

====PERFORMANCE
====USABILITY
====SECURITY



==C.I.A. TRIAD (CONCEPT)
Concerns with software systems and data management

====CONFIDENTIALITY (PRIVACY)

----What? Prevent unauthorized access (by systems, processes, individuals)
------Principle of least privilege

----When?
------In storage (data-at-rest)
------In process
------In transit

----How can we ensure? Access controls, safeguards, encryption,...

----Threat? Deliberate act like i.e. eavesdropping, accident,...

====INTEGRITY

----What?
------Keep data in original state / protect from editing, destruction,...
------Ensure authenticity of data origin / prevent non-repudiation

----When? Cf supra

----How can we ensure? Cryptographic hashing

----Threat? Deliberate act like editing, spoofing, replay (How?)

====AVAILABILITY

----What? Ensuring reliable and timely access to network service and data

----When? Always when necessary

----How can we ensure? Backups of data, redundancy of systems

----Threat: possible attack like a denial of service (DoS - slow down or interrupt), distributed denial of service (DDoS), also accident, hardware/software failure, environmental concern,... (How?) Cf Cisco course

====ADDED VALUE OF C.I.A.
Simplify the (strategic) security goals and (tactical, concrete, measurable) objectives for policy writers, system architects, security practitioners

====RISK MANAGEMENT
Used to evaluate risks and vulnerabilities based on the threat to any of the three C.I.A. principles

====APPLICATION
Respect in governance, practice, technical implementation



==DATA BREACH
Unauthorized access, intentional or by accident



==DATA EXFILTRATION
Type of data breach, but intentional



==DATA LOSS
Temporal or permanent unavailability



==ATTACK

====PREVENT - DETECT - STOP / MITIGATE
====TYPES OF ATTACK



==EXPLOITS
A program / code designed to find and exploit vulnerabilities in software code / systems for malicious purposes

A method, not a malware itself



==ATTACKERS

====INDIVIDUALS / ORGANISED CRIME GROUPS (OCG)
Motive: Financial

====SECRET / MILITARY SERVICES
Motive: defence, espionage

====HACKTIVISTS / ORGANISED GROUPS
Motive: political

Usually the most unpredictable



==TERMINOLOGY

====THREAT (situation / event)

====POSSIBLE THREAT (theoretical)

====RISK (condition / uncertain event)

====RISK ANALYSIS (probability and impact)

====SECURITY INCIDENT (event with a threat + vulnerability at the same time and security measures not implemented)

====VULNERABILITY (situation that makes a threat possible)
In software, information systems, security procedures, internal controls,...


==MALWARE
Malicious software

====ADWARE: malware that serves adds

====RISKWARE: legitimate software that can be abused with malicous intent

====TROJANS: seems useful but contains malicous code

====LOGIC BOMBS: code runs when certain conditions are met

====VIRUSES: can reproduce by attaching to an existing program - Usually targets files

====WORMS: can reproduce autonomously in a network - Lots of bandwidth use

====BACKDOORS: hidden access in soft- or hardware



==GOALS
Usually financial



==METHODS

====BOTNETS

====BACKDOORS

====CLICKJACKING

====KEYLOGGERS

====PROXIES (to hide own connection)



==INFECTION VECTORS

====SOFTWARE
Vulnerabilities in files, Apps,...

====AUTORUN

====DRIVE-BY DOWNLOADS
By exploiting code bugs in browsers

====CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING
Absence of validation or cleaning of input on websites



==INCIDENT RESPONSE

====INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM (IRT)

====INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN (IRP)



==CYBERSECURITY ROLES
