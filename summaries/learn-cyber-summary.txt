==C.I.A. TRIAD (CONCEPT)
Concerns with software systems and data management

--SECURITY GOALS
Strategic

--SECURITY OBJECTIVES
Tactical, concrete, measurable

Based on authentication / authorization

--RISK MANAGEMENT
Used to evaluate risks and vulnerabilities based on the threat to any of the three C.I.A. principles

--APPLICATION
Respect in governance, practice, technical implementation

--CONFIDENTIALITY (PRIVACY)
----What? prevent unauthorized access (by systems, processes, individuals)
----When?
------In storage (data-at-rest)
------In process
------In transit
----How? access controls, safeguards,...
----Threat? possible attack like i.e. eavesdropping (How?)
----Protection: i.e. encryption

--INTEGRITY
----Editing
----Threat: possible attack like editing, spoofing, replay (How?)
----Protection: ...

--AVAILABILITY
----Threat: possible attack: denial of service (DoS - slow down or interrupt), distributed denial of service (DDoS) (How?) Cf Cisco course
----Protection: ...


==ATTACK

--PREVENT - STOP - DETECT
--TYPES OF ATTACK


==EXPLOITS

Vulnerabilites in software code can cause systems to be exploited


==ATTACKERS

--INDIVIDUALS / ORGANISED CRIME GROUPS
----Motive: Financial

--SECRET / MILITARY SERVICES
----Motive: defence, espionage

--HACKTIVISTS / ORGANISED GROUPS
----Motive: political
----Usually the most unpredictable


==TERMINOLOGY

--THREAT (situation, event)
--POSSIBLE THREAT (theoretical)
--RISK (uncertain event, condition)
--RISK ANALYSIS (probability and impact)
--SECURITY INCIDENT (event with a threat + vulnerability at the same time and security measures not implemented)
--VULNERABILITY (situation that makes a threat possible): in software, information systems, security procedures, internal control,...


==MALWARE
(Malicious software)

--ADWARE: malware that serves adds
--RISKWARE: legitimate software that can be abused with malicous intent

--TROJANS: seems useful but contains malicous code
--LOGIC BOMBS: code runs when certain conditions are met
--VIRUSES: can reproduce by attaching to an existing program - usually targets files
--WORMS: can reproduce autonomously in a network - they use lots of bandwidth
--BACKDOORS: hidden access in soft- or hardware


==GOALS
Usually financial


==METHODS

--BOTNETS
--BACKDOORS
--CLICKJACKING
--KEYLOGGERS
--PROXIES (to hide own connection)


==INFECTION VECTORS

--SOFTWARE (vulnerabilities in files, Apps,...)
--AUTORUN
--DRIVE-BY DOWNLOADS (exploit of code bug in browsers)
--CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (absence of validation or cleaning of input on websites)


==INCIDENT RESPONSE

----INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM (IRT)
----INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN (IRP)


==CYBERSECURITY ROLES
